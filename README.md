# INFO-474-Final
This is the repository for Scott Kinder, Drew Khaw, and Cory Brown's i474 final project. In this interactive website, we explore KNN Classification through various interactive examples built in d3 and in other ways. The first three examples are built in d3, with the nn.js, voronoi.js, and knn.js, respectively. We built the last example (KNN Decision Boundary) in R because of the fact no one has done a good example of that before (see: http://bl.ocks.org/Bcohn/raw/088cf00bcda052c2e5a7/), and for us to do that would take some serious coding skilling implementing that with all the math involved; it would have essentially been our project. However, we are very happy with the final result, and have already taught a lot of people about the KNN algorithm! We also have had a lot of fun playing with the interactive charts, and we have also learned a bit more about the algorithm ourselves. Documentation for the respective libraries are located in the files themselves or on the respective github repo's for the individual files. Enjoy!
